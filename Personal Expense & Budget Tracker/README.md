## Motive behind creating this app
This project was created because I (Amrit Gautam, the creater) realized that my friends, especially my best friend were spending money unnecessarily, mostly on outdoor eating, buying unimportant stuff etc, so I thought,"Why not create an app that lets them track their expenses, lets them see & compare their expenses and reminds them if certain limit is reached."

Sure, there might be alot better apps out there but my friends are some of the best procastinators out there, so they won't download those apps even if they did after i insisted them, they would stop using it within a day. So, I thought that if I told them to try this new app I created and tell me how good or bad it is, they might stick for a while even if it's to make me feel good and I am able to make the app interesting, they might stick to it and potentially, their bad habits might be solved.

## Updates and versions:-
1. **v0.1: Terminal based** - A very basic and limited version of the app was created which had major flaws.
2. **v0.2: Terminal based** - New version was created after fixing the flaws of earlier verison and adding new features such as:
   - Delete a row
   - Delete a column
   - Comparing expenses in graphs
3. **v0.3: GUI based** - New version was created by making it gui based and a cleaner/smoother interface was given to user, but comparing expenses in graph feature & show total spent feature wasn't included.
4. **v0.4: GUI bassed** - New version was created by fixing the bugs of earlier version, including the lost feature and reducing user's effort as much as possible by making user take decisions by via clickable options.
